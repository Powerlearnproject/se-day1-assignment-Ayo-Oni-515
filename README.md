# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and scalable.

    Its importance in the technology industry includes:

        1. Enhancing software quality by following structured methodologies.

        2. Ensuring maintainability to support future modifications.

        3. Improving efficiency through best coding practices.

        4. Reducing development costs by minimizing errors early in the development process.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1950s - Birth of Software Development: Early programming involved direct machine code and assembly language.

    1968 - NATO Conference on Software Engineering: Recognized the "software crisis" and emphasized structured development.

    2001 - Agile Manifesto: Introduced flexible and iterative software development methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining software needs.

    Planning – Creating project timelines, budget, and resource allocation.

    Design – Architectural and system design decisions.

    Implementation (Coding) – Writing and developing the software.

    Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs.

    Deployment – Releasing the software for user access.

    Maintenance – Ongoing updates and improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

| Feature           | Waterfall                                      | Agile                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Approach**      | Sequential                                     | Iterative                              |
| **Flexibility**   | Low                                            | High                                   |
| **Feedback**      | Late-stage                                     | Continuous                             |
| **Best Use Case** | Well-defined projects with stable requirements | Dynamic projects with evolving needs   |

    Example Scenarios:

    Waterfall: Developing safety-critical software like medical devices.

    Agile: Building a customer-facing web application with frequent updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code.

    Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards.

    Project Manager: Oversees project progress, timelines, and resource allocation.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing. Examples: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.

    Version Control Systems (VCS): Manage source code changes. Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    Challenge: Managing changing requirements → Solution: Use Agile methodologies.

    Challenge: Debugging complex systems → Solution: Implement thorough testing strategies.

    Challenge: Collaboration in large teams → Solution: Use version control (e.g., GitHub).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., functions).

    Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together.

    System Testing: Verifies the entire system's functionality.

    Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets business requirements.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs for AI models to generate accurate and useful responses. It is crucial for improving AI interactions, ensuring relevance, and optimizing outputs in AI applications.

   

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

     Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."

    Improved Prompt: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnostic tools and patient management."

    Why the Improved Prompt is Better?

    More specific: Defines the topic scope (AI in healthcare).

    Clearer expectations: Specifies areas (diagnostic tools, patient management).

    Concise yet detailed: Ensures a targeted response.
